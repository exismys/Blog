Exactly what the name says. Physics, Math, Programming, whatever. The best way to learn something is to explain it, as they say.

# An Important Note
My purpose in writing these blogs is not to teach anyone anything. It is to learn things. As people have said, the best way to understand something is to explain it in simple and clear words.

So, here I am explaining things to no one, and perhaps I can look back at them as a reference. Feedback is welcome.
