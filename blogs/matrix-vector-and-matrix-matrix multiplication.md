## Matrix-Vector Multiplication ($ A \mathbf{v} $)

A Matrix $ A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} $ in general can be thought of as a linear transformation from $ \mathbb{R}^n $ to $ \mathbb{R}^m $.

Terminologies:
- $ \mathbb{R} $ : the set of real numbers.
- $ \mathbb{R}^n $ : the space of all n-dimensional vectors whose components are real numbers.

**What do we mean transformation and more specifically linear transformation?**

Transformation can be thought of as a function which takes a vector as an input and outputs another vector.

Specifically, a linear transformation transforms a vector space without "bending" any of vectors in it.
