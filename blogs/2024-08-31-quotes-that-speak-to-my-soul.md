*I will keep updating this...*

I have been coming across quotes all my life - in books, in cinema, everywhere. I encounter them on daily basis and shake them off like any other pervasive thing. But, sometimes you come across words that you just can't shake off. They open your mind to a new line of thinking and you are just so grateful to have encountered them because otherwise you would have missed the wonder and awe you are feeling right now.

**So this is the place for those kind of words.**

> “You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing.”
>
> — Alan Watts

> “Try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up. What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born.”</p>
> — Alan Watts

**These ones are from cinema:**

> “Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. And so we ask ourselves: will our actions echo across the centuries? Will strangers hear our names long after we are gone, and wonder who we were, how bravely we fought, how fiercely we loved?”
>
> — Wolfgang Petersen, Troy

>“I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution. We became too self aware; nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody’s nobody. I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last midnight, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.”
>
>— Rust Cohle, True Detective

and from other places...

> “The statement that says “only statements which can be verified by experience are meaningful” is in itself not verifiable. Perfect, objective truth is epistemically unknowable because the world is endlessly perceived by subjects.”
>
