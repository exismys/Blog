I want to teach. I have this urge of teaching people and learning myself simultaneously. I feel like this is my calling, and I will do so very effortlessly. I don't have the necessary resources to do this but that's what I want to do and I think I should try this anyhow.

**Why do I want this? What elements of my interests does it have?**

I think the learning aspect of the process is what excites me the most. I have always been fond of exploring new ideas. And explaining and teaching what I have learnt to others satisfies my inherent urge to tell someone how amazing and wonderful a thing is and seeing them getting excited in the same way.

Also the idea of teaching what I know somewhat adds usefulness to the process of learning.
