```
you are an agent of nature,
not separate from it.
whatever is your will,
is the will of nature.

you are nature.
```

```
a thing of aggregates, 
influenced by each of them variably, 
with none having the full control.
```

```
your eyes are moving along the lines on a page, and you come across a sentence, an epiphany so intense that you burst into tears because it reminded you a part of yourself that you had forgotten.
```

```
a good dream is preferred, but lately even a nightmare is a good happening. it's proof that i was asleep. most days i wake up tired, my fist clenched, and unsure if i slept even for one hour.
```

```
can I not think what I'll do tomorrow?
just to witness it unfold,
take part in the dance,
and improvise.
```
