A thought... Suppose everything that exists is an arrangement of matter in 3 spatial dimensions. Suppose time is another dimension and there are arrangements of matter along that as well. The arrangement is already there, so, in a sense, time is not something that flows. What we see as motion is our mind's ability to connect cascading arrangement of matter along this dimension and form a narrative. Time as an invention of something strange that is our mind.

This is how I think the movie "Arrival" is meant to interpreted.

"Weapon opens time."
The mind is implied as something ethereal, connected across this special dimension (time), but blocked by its tendency to only move forward, accessing the next frame of the reel. The language is the technology that augments the mind, more accurately tapping into this pervading consciousness instead of the time itself.
