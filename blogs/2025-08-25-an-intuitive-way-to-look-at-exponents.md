# An Intuitive Way to Look at Exponents

**Exponents are actually about a third secret number.**

I will try to explain this with an example.

Let's say that the initial population of a country or group (a, original number): 100

This population is doubling each generation/iteration (base): 2 (3, if tripling)

Number of generations/iterations (exponent): 4

Question: what will be the population after 4 generations?

This will be: (base ^ iterations) times the original population.

2^4 = 16 times the original number = 100 Ã— 16 = 1600

So, 2^4 is the factor by which the population (originally 100) would have grown after 4 generations.


Now, let's consider our case:

b^0

This represents 0 generation after (it does not matter if population is doubling or tripling or whatever). So, by what factor would the original population have grown in 0 generations?

It would have grown by a factor of exactly 1. Because no time has passed. Population remains the same.

That's why b^0 = 1 (1 represents the factor by which something would have grown)

So, it does not matter if the base is 2, 3, or -1. After 0 iteration, the factor always remains 1.
